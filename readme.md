<h1>Calculator Project</h1>
It works like a normal Calculator But performs function Only on the present As Well As The Last Output i.e we can not give inputs in repetition unless we press (Equal To).<br>
for eg. enter(first no.) , then operator and then (second no.) . After entering these we have to press equal to operator.<br>
if we click any function operator instead of Equal to then (Second No.) Will Become First No. and present input becomes (Second No.) i.e Function takes place on The Present input And The Second No.
